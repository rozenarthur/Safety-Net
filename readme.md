## About Safety Net

The software system to be developed by Foo Bar Software is Safety Net. The purpose of Safety Net is to provide the client with a way to keep his/her network secure. Safety Net users will be network administrators and the individuals who access their network. Safety Net will be able to provide adequate security for the client and his/her network. Safety Net will be able to keep undesirable and possibly malicious internet bots or users from gaining access to the clientâ€™s networks or websites. To achieve this, Safety Net will require three types of information that the user must provide as authentication when accessing the network or website. These will be username, password, and a minimum of three security questions. The passwords of the users will also have expirations, so Safety Net will remind its users of this.
